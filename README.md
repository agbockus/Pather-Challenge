#Path Problem
##Pather

This small program takes a specified input and output file, reads the input for '#' characters and draws a path of '*' between them.

There are three rules that the path must follow:
* No diagonals.
* Only change direction once per pair of hashes.
* Start with a vertical line and then complete with a horizontal line.

## Usage
First, unzip the folder and navigate to the folder in a command line.<br /><br />

Ensure that <code>path-problem.sh</code> is executable by running:
<pre><code>chmod +x path-problem.sh</code></pre>

You can then run this program with the following command(s):
<pre><code>./path-problem.sh</code></pre>

<!--
## Testing
In order to test this, you must have rspec installed.
It can be tested using the following command:
<pre><code>rspec spec</code></pre>
